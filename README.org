* About
~vtm~ manages ~vterm~ buffers with configuration files.

Especially useful when sshing to many hosts simultaneously.

* Features
1. Name of the vterm buffer can be explicitly specified by configuration or
   implicitly infered from configuration file name. So users can switch between
   different vterm buffer easily.
2. Multiple strings can be sent to vterm buffer by configuration.
3. Control characters can be sent to vterm buffer by configuration.
4. Time to sleep before sending string or control characters can be specified by
   configuration.

* Usage
1. Create a /.vtm/ file (e.g. /host.vtm/), ~vtm~ will populate it with an
   example config.
2. Edit the /.vtm/ file as your wish, then close the buffer.
3. Open the /.vtm/ file like a normal file, a ~vterm~ buffer will be opened
   instead.
4. Toggle ~vtm-edit-mode~ to switch between editing the /.vtm/ file and openning
   the ~vterm~ buffer.

* Install
Just install ~vtm~ from ~melpa~.
